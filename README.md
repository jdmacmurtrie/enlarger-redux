# Redux Size Adjuster

Redux Size Adjuster is my first exploration into redux.  It is an extraordinarily simple app which will also serve as a template for further Redux apps.

## Getting Started & Installing

This app uses NPM version 5.6.0.
```sh
$ npm -v
=> 5.6.0
```

Install NPM for your `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` folder.
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Setting Up

In order to run the app in a development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ npm start
```
Then, navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.
